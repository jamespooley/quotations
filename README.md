Quotations I like the sound of or want to remember for one reason or another. Posting != endorsement in all cases, etc. etc.

### Music

* "_Sounds_ ... was named after a remark by Albert Ayler that the future of music
would no longer be about notes, it would be about sounds." (David Stubs in _Future Days: Krautrock and the Birth of a Revolutionary New Music_) [TODO: Track down original quotation.]


### Statistics

* All models are wrong, but some are useful ... Now it would be very remarkable if any system existing in the real world could be exactly represented by any simple model. However, cunningly chosen parsimonious models often do provide remarkably useful approximations. For example, the law `PV = RT` relating pressure `P`, volume `V` and temperature `T` of an "ideal" gas via a constant R is not exactly true for any real gas, but it frequently provides a useful approximation and furthermore its structure is informative since it springs from a physical view of the behavior of gas molecules ...  For such a model there is no need to ask the question "Is the model true?." If "truth" is to be the "whole truth" the answer must be "No." The only question of interest is ‚ÄúIs the model illuminating and useful?‚Äù. (George Box)
* Sometimes a simple model will outperform a more complex model [...] Nevertheless, I believe that deliberately limiting the complexity of the model is not fruitful when the problem is evidently complex. Instead, if a simple model is found that outperforms some particular complex model, the appropriate response is to define a different complex model that captures whatever aspect of the problem led to the simple model performing well.
